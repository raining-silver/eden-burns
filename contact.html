    <p>Hey, I'm the founder of the project and the creator of the website. I made this as a collaborative writing project among friends, just to have some fun and work on our writing skills while telling an interesting story, and the website I just made for convenience's sake. I won't miss typing everything out into discord messages. As of typing this, the project consists of five members, myself included, with a sixth likely incoming. I've had fun with the project so far and I'm excited to see where it goes. Please enjoy the stories! :)</p>
