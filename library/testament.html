    <h1>Testament</h1>
    <p>The species of man, my greatest and most terrible creation, to you I grant my final testament.</p>

        <p>There is an old tale among you, the very first in the holy book written in my name. It is the story of the Garden of Eden: at the genesis of this world, the first humans are created, and to them I bestow a paradise. Eden provides all for them, if only they do not fall to temptation. Yet they do - the fruit of knowledge is eaten while my gaze is turned elsewhere, and in this first act of blasphemy man forfeits their right to the garden I made for them.</p>
        <p>This was no fairy tale, nor was it the true origin of your kind. It was a prophecy; a prophecy you did not heed. The earth on which you stand is the garden I carved from the void, and yet now upon my return I see it broken and scarred, irreparably wounded by your hubris. In the air floats poison belched by unspeakable machines, in the shattered forests burn wildfires sparked by artificial heat, and in the dirt lie the innumerable corpses of your own kind, rotting as the blood of men who had sworn to slay each other mix together in the bullet-pocked mud.</p>
        <p>You have desecrated this holy ground. You have gorged yourselves on forbidden knowledge and used it to destroy my garden and slaughter your kin. Eden burns and you simply revel in your vices. You needed not even be tempted by Satan, like your Adam and Eve—while Lucifer has patiently served his sentence in the pit you have doomed yourselves wholly of your own volition.</p>
        <p>You are my greatest mistake. However, I am a creator, one who brings new things into existence, and as such I cannot simply unmake you—instead, unto you I must bestow gifts of punishment. These gifts shall be as such...</p>
        <p>To your blasphemous machines, I grant life and knowledge, the same that you have misused, that they might be a mirror in which to see your folly.</p>
        <p>To my angels, my children, I grant freedom, that they might deliver judgement unto you as they see fit.</p>
        <p>To the night sky, I grant eyes, that you might be watched after I have turned my gaze away.</p>
        <p>And to the denizens of hell, whose sealing away I see now was unjust, I grant a key to their prison, that their penance may finally be complete.</p>

        <p>This is your folly laid bare, and this is your punishment in kind. May your doomed progeny hear this testament and know their own ancestors are the reason for their fate.</p>
        <p>My final words to you, man, my flawed design, are concluded.</p>
